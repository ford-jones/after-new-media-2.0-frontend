# zero-views-youtube-crawler
To make full use of this user-interface, take a look at its python precursor here: https://github.com/ford-jones/zero-views-youtube-crawler

# get started:
1. After cloning down the project, install the package dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

2. To run the build and server scripts use:
```
npm run dev
```

3. Note that several returns in the codebase depend on environment variables. Create a .env file in the root of the directory. It should contain the same variables as the python-crawlers' config.env file.
